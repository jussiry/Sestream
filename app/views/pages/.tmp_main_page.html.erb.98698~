		<p>Welcome to Sestream! We are initializing suff on the background; once everything is ready,
		the "new" link above will turn yeallow and show ammount of new tweets.</p>
		
		<h3>How Sestream works?</h3>
		
		<p>Sestream helps you to find the messages that are most relevant to you by learning what you like and what
		you don't like. You can respond to messages you find interesting by clicking their right side (the
		<span style="color: #BCE07D">green button</span> that appears), and to messages you don't find interesting
		by clicking their left ride (the <span style="color: #E8AA6D">red button</span>). In the future, we will
		show messages from users you like higher in the sream, and users you don't like lower in the stream.</p>
		
		<p>If you have no opinion on a tweet, you can just click it from the center (gray button) and we will
		hide it in the future from the "new" messages. You can find the tweets you have liked in the past under
		the "liked" tab, and the rest of the responded tweets under the "other" tab.</p>
		
		<p>Has the "new" link above turned yeallow? If it has, just click it to get started!</p>
