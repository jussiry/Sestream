	If you'r following many people on Twitter you'v probably found out that there's lots of clutter between the grains.
	<strong>Tweetjudge</strong> is a new interface for Twitter designed to solve this problem by allowing you to tell us
	which tweets you like and which you don't. We then analyze the metadata of these tweets (users, hashtags, etc.),
	and in the future will order the tweets according to your interests. We also format the tweets so that they are
	much more pleasant to read, take full use of Twitters reply functionality (not implemented yet),
	and introduce many other smaller improvements.  
	<br/><br/>
	Service is still in early stage of development, but if you don't mind occasional glitches, you'r very welcome to try it out.
